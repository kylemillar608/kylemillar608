### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my page!

#### Experience:

At work, I focus on creating AWS-hosted financial microservices for Asurion. Most of my programming at Asurion has utilized Java/Spring Boot, but our team has recently transitioned into TypeScript/Koa. Some projects I have worked on: subscriber, invoicing, and payments services, implementing a shared OIDC/PingFederate authentication and authorization solution across our fleet of microservices, and leading development of our in-house feature flagging solution as well as our returns tracking and customer communications microservice. Find more details on my [resume](https://www.github.com/kylemillar608/kylemillar608/resume/)!
