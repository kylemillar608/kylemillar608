### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Welcome to my page! Take a look around... There is not much to be seen at this moment - have been busy at work. I'm hoping to focus a bit more on personal projects in the coming months, so stick around for updates. 

Meanwhile...

At work, I focus on creating AWS-hosted financial microservices for Asurion (provide device insurance, warranties, and support). Most of my work there was using Spring Boot/Java, but our team has recently transitioned into TypeScript/Koa. Some projects I have worked on: subscriber, invoicing, and payments services, implementing a shared OAuth2.0 solution across our fleet of microservices, and leading development on our own feature flagging solution as well as our returns tracking microservice. Find more details on my resume! 

Personally...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a solution to asynchronous micro-task scheduling. Find more details and the code in the Boomerang repo!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java(Type)Script and Koa Web Framework as well as the modules that go along with those things (ie. Jest, TypeORM, etc.)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Koa middleware and TypeScript modules (think Json validation/Swagger, AWS SQS integration), reactive streaming apps, or quantitative finance software.
