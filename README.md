### Hi there 👋

#### Welcome to my page! Take a look around... There is not much to be seen at this moment - have been busy at work. I'm hoping to focus a bit more on personal projects in the coming months, so stick around for updates. 

#### Meanwhile...

At work, I focus on creating AWS-hosted financial microservices for Asurion (provides device insurance, warranties, and support). Most of my programming at Asurion has utilized Spring Boot/Java, but our team has recently transitioned into TypeScript/Koa. Some projects I have worked on: subscriber, invoicing, and payments services, implementing a shared OIDC/PingFederate authentication and authorization solution across our fleet of microservices, and leading development on our in-house feature flagging solution as well as our returns tracking microservice. Find more details on my [resume](https://www.github.com/kylemillar608/kylemillar608/resume/)!

#### Personally...

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a solution to asynchronous micro-task scheduling. Find more details and the code in the [Boomerang](https://www.github.com/kylemillar608/Boomerang) repo!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java(Type)Script and Koa Web Framework as well as the modules that typically go along with them (ie. Jest, TypeORM, etc.)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Koa middleware and TypeScript modules (think Json validation/Swagger, AWS SQS integration), reactive streaming apps, or quantitative finance software.
